                would be towards spacious, luxurious living so Vu an Tecca
                accommodates 4 people very comfortably rather than 6+ in cramped
                quarters. That said, there is a travel cot for infants.
                Featuring modern d√©cor throughout, the lounge boasts comfortable
                ivory leather sofas and the dining area enjoys contemporary
                chrome & glass dining suite with ivory leather dining chairs.</p>`

                enclosed private garden area to the rear of the chalet where a
                mature planted screen provides an excellent wind break and
                natural private sun trap. Deck chairs, table and parasol are

<p class="subtitle-1">The master bedroom overlooks the rear garden area and features a King Size posturepedic bed with 2 x full size built-in wardrobes,
dressing table area and large bedside cabinets. Flat screen LCD TV with Freeview & built in DVD player.

bags, coats etc. In here you will find an iron and an ironing board, and all cleaning equipment such as a vacuum, brooms, cloaks store etc.</p>`
